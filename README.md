### Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel Silva.
#### I'm from Porto, Portugal, and currently a Developer @ konkConsulting.

Feel free to look around. Despite my current work not involving GitHub directly (there are other hosting services for Git repositories, you know ðŸ˜›), I still have the habit of coming back here to work on my own personal stuff and see what's going on in my network.
